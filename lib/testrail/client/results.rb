    # Methods for the Results API
    # Use the following API methods to request details about test results and to add new test results.
    #
    # @see http://docs.gurock.com/testrail-api2/reference-results
    #
    # Returns a list of test results for a test.
    #
    # @param [Integer, String] test_id  The ID of the test
    # @return a list of test results for a test
    # @see http://docs.gurock.com/testrail-api2/reference-results#get_results
    def results(test_id)
      get("get_results/#{test_id}")
    end

    #
    # Returns a list of test results for a test run and case combination.
    # The difference to get_results is that this method expects a test run + test case instead of a test. In TestRail,
    # tests are part of a test run and the test cases are part of the related test suite.
    # So, when you create a new test run, TestRail creates a test for each test case found in the test suite of the run.
    # You can therefore think of a test as an “instance” of a test case which can have test results, comments and a test status.
    # Please also see TestRail's getting started guide for more details about the differences between test cases and tests.
    #
    # This method uses the same response format as get_results.
    #
    # :run_id	The ID of the test run
    # :case_id	The ID of the test case

    # 4 Retest
    # 5 Failed

    # @option data [String] :comment The comment / description for the test result
    # @option data [String] :version The version or build you tested against
    # @option data [String] :elapsed The time it took to execute the test, e.g. "30s" or "1m 45s"
    # @option data [Array<Integer>, Array<String>] :defects A comma-separated list of defects to link to the test result
